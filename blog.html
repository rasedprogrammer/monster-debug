			<h1>
				Question-01: What is difference between local storage and session
				storage in javascript?
			</h1>
			<p>
				<b>Local storage:</b> is the most recent mechanism. It allows for larger
				amounts of data to be stored, but the data is not deleted when the
				browser is closed. Local storage is useful for storing data that the
				user will need to access later, such as offline data.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Session storage:</b> is similar to cookies, but the data is only
				stored for the current session. This means that the data will be deleted
				when the user closes the browser. Session storage is useful for storing
				data that is sensitive, such as login credentials.
			</p>
			<h1>
				Question-02: What is the difference between global scope and block scope
				in JavaScript?
			</h1>
			<p>
				In a browser environment, the global scope is controlled by the window
				object while in Node. js, it's controlled by the global object. Block
				scopes are what you get when you use if statements, for statements, and
				the like.
			</p>
			<h1>Question-03: How does the Event Loop works in JavaScript?</h1>
			<p>
				The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the
				Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the
				first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which
				effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event
				Loop.
			</p>
			<h1>Question-04: How many ways can we get undefined in JavaScript?</h1>
			<p>
				undefined means, value of the variable is not defined. JavaScript has a
				global variable undefined whose value is "undefined" and typeof
				undefined is also "undefined". Remember, undefined is not a constant or
				a keyword. undefined is a type with exactly one value: undefined.
				Assigning a new value to it does not change the value of the type
				undefined.
			</p>
			<h3>8 Ways to get Undefined:</h3>
			<ol class="list-item">
				<li>A declared variable without assigning any value to it.</li>
				<li>Implicit returns of functions due to missing return statements.</li>
				<li>return statements that do not explicitly return anything.</li>
				<li>Lookups of non-existent properties in an object.</li>
				<li>Function parameters that have not passed.</li>
				<li>Anything that has been set to the value of undefined.</li>
				<li>Any expression in the form of void(expression)</li>
				<li>The value of the global variable undefined</li>
			</ol>
